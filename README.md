#Play 2 Crud module

A flexible Play framework 2.1 crud module. This module is in development, many features are missing and there is no documentation yet.

##Usage

### Dependencies

Add repository (snapshots for now) in `Build.scala` to your resolvers

	resolvers += Resolver.url("njin github repository (snapshots)", url("http://njin-fr.github.com/repository/snapshots"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns),

Add the core module dependency

	"fr.njin" % "play-crud" % "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

Add your data provider (only ebean for now)

    "fr.njin" % "play-crud-ebean" % "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
    
### Initialize

play-crud use play-2.1 controller instances for his routes (see [Managing Controller Class Instantiation](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.1-RC4/JavaInjection)). So you will have to use Global settings in your application (see [Global settings at playframework.org](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.1-RC4/JavaGlobal)).

First, initialize the manager on your application start:

	ControllersManager.init(new EbeanModelRegistry(application),
                new ClasspathScannerControllerRegistry(application),
                new EbeanDataProviderFactory());
	
Then, provide the instance to play:

	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	public <A> A getControllerInstance(Class<A> clazz) throws Exception {
		if(clazz.equals(ControllersManager.class)) {
            ControllersManager manager = ControllersManager.getInstance();
            return (A)manager;
		}
		return super.getControllerInstance(clazz);
	}

Finaly, add routes of the module in your `routes.conf`:

	->		/admin						play.crud.Routes

See [ebean sample](play-crud-tests/play-crud-ebean/) for an example.

### Add some controllers

Create a Class in your app classpath that extends `fr.njin.play.crud.controllers.Crud`. Exemple with an entity `Task` with a `Long` id:

	public class Tasks extends Crud<Long, Task> {
    	public Tasks() {
        	super(Long.class, Task.class);
	    }
	}
	
play-crud will scan your classpath and add this controller to his list.
